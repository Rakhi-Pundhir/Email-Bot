# Email-Bot

**Email Automation Bot using Python**

This project is a voice-controlled email assistant developed in Python. It allows users to send and read emails hands-free using voice commands. By integrating smtplib, imaplib, speech_recognition, and pyttsx3, the bot connects to Gmail servers to automate email operations. The assistant listens to user instructions via microphone, converts speech to text, fetches or composes emails accordingly, and reads out the results using text-to-speech. It simplifies email tasks and demonstrates automation, API integration, and natural language input handling
